# API-Access

The source code for the extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/api-access/jegnjmcegcpodciadcoeneecmkiccfgi

You can include the file enableCrossOrigin.js on your site to auto enable the extension. I have commented where you can include a white / black list of domains you want to include / exclude.
